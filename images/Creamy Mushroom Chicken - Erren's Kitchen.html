<p><strong>This creamy chicken with mushroom sauce</strong> makes a regular appearance on our dinner table, and there are never any leftovers! </p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<ul><li><em><strong><em><strong>The flour coating</strong>&nbsp;</em></strong>gives not only a delicious crust but helps the sauce coat the chicken.</em></li><li><em><strong>White wine </strong>gives the sauce a wonderful bright undertone.</em></li><li><em><strong><em><strong>Garlic and parmesan cheese </strong></em></strong><em>add dimension </em></em>and extra <em>flavor to the sauce.</em></li></ul>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Out of all the chicken recipes on this blog, this one is one of my favorites!</strong> Using thin chicken cutlets means a quicker cook time on and tender result.</p>



<p><strong>The silky cream sauce is packed with flavor and a true delight</strong>! I use&nbsp;baby bella (or Cremini) mushrooms, but any kind you like will work just fine.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>When buying chicken breast try to choose chicken with a pinky, flesh-colored tone.</strong>&nbsp; Chicken freshness is easily visible. As chicken spoils, color fades until it reaches a pale gray. It&rsquo;s always best to avoid buying chicken with any signs of discoloration.</p>

<p><strong>Pounding chicken breasts is not a necessity, but it does help to make your chicken an even thickness</strong>. This helps them cook at an even rate. It also helps to tenderize meaning your chicken will be more tender.</p>

<ul><li><em><strong>When pan-frying,&nbsp;</strong>don&rsquo;t skimp on the oil. You need enough to get a golden brown finish.</em></li><li><em><strong>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator</strong>&nbsp;around 20 minutes before you&rsquo;re ready to cook. This allows the chicken to cook evenly.</em></li><li><em><strong>Always wash your hands well after handling raw chicken throughout the cooking process.&nbsp;</strong>This helps to avoid cross-contamination.</em></li><li><em><strong>Keep the heat at a constant, high temperature </strong></em>this stops the flour from absorbing the oil and becoming soggy.</li><li><em><strong>Don&rsquo;t overcrowd the pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This causes the chicken to steam instead of fry and causes the coating to become soggy. It&rsquo;s better to fry in batches.</em></li><li><strong><em>If you don&rsquo;t have any wine</em></strong><em> you can replace it with the same amount in chicken stock.</em></li></ul>

<li><em><strong>When pan-frying,&nbsp;</strong>don&rsquo;t skimp on the oil. You need enough to get a golden brown finish.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator</strong>&nbsp;around 20 minutes before you&rsquo;re ready to cook. This allows the chicken to cook evenly.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Always wash your hands well after handling raw chicken throughout the cooking process.&nbsp;</strong>This helps to avoid cross-contamination.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Keep the heat at a constant, high temperature&nbsp;</strong></em>this stops the flour from absorbing the oil and becoming soggy.</li>
<li><em><strong>Don&rsquo;t overcrowd the pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This causes the chicken to steam instead of fry and causes the coating to become soggy. It&rsquo;s better to fry in batches.</em></li>
